Front end for UP Next, NTV 3rd term final project. This repository is the frontend code - the API code can be found [here](https://github.com/Tingvars/tdAPI).

50/50: Full-stack project

To run the Flutter code, you will need to have an appropriate editor (e.g. Android Studio) installed: ([Installing Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)). You will also need to have Flutter installed: ([Installing Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)). From there you can run the code either by setting up a virtual device (see Android Studio install instructions) and running it on that, or by running it in a browser through AS.
